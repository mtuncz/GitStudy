what is the master branch?
- working valid location
- the actual code everyone will use
- we are not gonna push to our master branch
- we do not directly push to the master branch
- we can make copy of the files by branching
- when we are ready, whatever branch we were using for, we could combine
- branch is a copy environment/flow for development
- HEAD: current branch/commit that is being viewed
    - detached head: when you are checked out to a commit
    - do not do any changes on a detached head, only on branches
- Checkout: Switch the head to a branch/commit
  - the way we switch between branches
- Merge: combine changes from branches together


- How to branch
    - git log -> right click on the master branch -> new branch from selected
    - git menu -> new branch
    - checkout branch- meaning we are switching branches

- on tags origin means remote repository
- master means local
- when we make a branch, it is copying of that branch up to that point in time where we make a new branch. It is copying the current state of that branch at that point.
- Head is to way to know where you are at
