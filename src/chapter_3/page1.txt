git is not about tracking folders, it is about tracking files.

if not file is in a folder, we cannot track the folder itself only

- if the file appears red, it means it is unversioned
- that means, we are not keeping track of it.
- if we commit sth, it means it goes to our local repository
- once we commit, that means we are committing them.

- commit: saved my changes to my local repository
- push: sending the changes in the local repository to the remote repository
