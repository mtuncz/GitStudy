git is not about tracking folders, it is about tracking files.

if not file is in a folder, we cannot track the folder itself only

- if the file appears red, it means it is unversioned
- that means, we are not keeping track of it.
- if we commit sth, it means it goes to our local repository
- once we commit, that means we are committing them.

- commit: saved my changes to my local repository
- push: sending the changes in the local repository to the remote repository

- changes in versioned files will show under the changes under commit tab

- before committing, there is a staging step, staging means get it ready to be committed.

- staging is not optional step, we need staging to commit, we need to select the file in order to commit

- staging happens before committing

- staging is selecting what to commit

- without staging we cannot commit

- each commit is a change we are making, they are the save points

- fetch will bring the new data without added to our local project right away, useful if you want to see what was the changes before putting them in your project

- to update your local repository with the new changes from the remote we can pull

- updating will apply changes to the same branch
